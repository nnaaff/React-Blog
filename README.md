# React-Blog
A sample blog created using **React.js** to illustrate its functionalities as I begin learning it.

This project is based on the *Full Modern React Tutorial* series provided by *The Net Ninja*. Check out [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) for very helpful, precise yet comprehensive web-development tutorials (beginner-friendly & each accompanied by a mini-project).

## Installation 
Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js on your system.
