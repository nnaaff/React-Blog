# React-Blog
A sample blog created using React.js to illustrate the basic concepts of this library.

This project is based on the *Full Modern React Tutorial* series provided by *The Net Ninja*. Check out [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) for very helpful, precise yet comprehensive web-development tutorials (beginner-friendly & each accompanied by a mini-project).
